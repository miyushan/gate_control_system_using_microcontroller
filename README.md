alphanumeric code authentication gate control system using microcontroller

 Designing a unique alphanumeric code authentication gate control system using microcontroller.

Which have a master node and two slave nodes. Master node is the main server, Slave nodes are the gate controllers. 

• Master Node is responsible for getting passenger information using GUI, creating unique alphanumeric code, 
storing unique alphanumeric code, authenticating unique alphanumeric code

• Slave nodes are responsible for getting unique alphanumeric code from the passenger using GUI, sending the 
unique alphanumeric code to the master node for authentication, return the authentication status to the user 
through GUI, control the gate.

• Establish an SPI communication protocol for interconnecting the master and slave microcontrollers.
